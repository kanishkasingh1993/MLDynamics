Accelerating Wavepacket propagation with Machine Learning 

This repository contains the code for the publication: xxx
The requirements.txt contains the instructions on the necessary libraries for the implementation of the code.
Two Fourier Neural Operator models (), following the implementations of the main FNO implementation in pytorch were trained and used in this work.
Pre-trained models and data used for training the models can be obtained from the following link.
